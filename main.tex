\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to investigate the Lebesgue measure and some of its applications in probability measure. 

\subsection{Measure}

How do we measure a set or an object? If we have a 3-dimensional object, we could find its volume in 2 different ways, we could fill the container with simple objects or $boxes$ and find their sum, or we could encase the whole container in a box and start chipping away smaller boxes. These approaches work only when our box measure is a properly defined measure. 

The mathematical concept of measure is a generalisation of length in $R$, area in $R^2$ or volume in $R^3$. To avoid splitting into cases depending on the dimension, we shall refer to the $measure$ of E, depending on what Euclidean space $R^n$ we are using and $E \subset R^n$.

We know the measure or length of an interval, say $[0,1]$, we also have $(0,1)$ and $(0,1]$, as these are subsets of our initial interval, their measures must not exceed that of $[0,1]$ (monotonic). Let us assume the length of this unit interval be 1. We let the measure to be zero, for a single point or an empty set, and infinite if we consider the real line. Ideally, we'd like to associate a non-negative measure $m(E)$ to every subset E of $R^n$. It should also obey some reasonable properties like $m(A \cup B) = m(A) + m(B)$ whenever A and B are disjoint, we should have $m(A) \leq m(B)$ whenever $A \subset B$, and $m(x+A)=m(A)$ (translation invariant). Here, we hit a roadblock in our definition of a measure:
$$(0,1)= \bigcup_{x \in (0,1)} \{x\} \, and \, 1 \neq \sum_{(0,1)}0$$

From our definition, we can also see that two sets having the same number of points need not have the same measure, let $A=[0,1]$ and $B=[0,2]$, there exists a bijection from A to B (x $\mapsto$ 2x), but B is twice as long as A.
 
 Remarkably, it turns out such a measure $does \, not \,exist$. This is quite a surprising fact, because it is counter-intuitive. These examples tell us that it is impossible to measure every subset of $R^n$ applying all the above properties. 
 
 If we are developing a measure $m$ defined on the subsets of R, we hope that these conditions are met:
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item $m(A)$ is defined for every set A of the real numbers;
     \item $0\leq m(A) \leq \infty$;
     \item $m(A) \leq m(B)$ provided $A \subset B$;
     \item $m(\phi) =0 $;
     \item $m(\{a\})=0$ (points are dimensionless);
     \item $m(I)=l(I)$, I is an interval (the measure on an interval should be its length)
     \item $m(A)=m(x+A)$, translation invariance, (location doesn't affect the length, so it shouldn't affect measure)
     \item $m(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty} {A_k}) = \sum_{1}^{\infty}m(A_k)$, for any mutually disjoint sequence $(A_k)$ of subsets of real numbers (countable additivity).
 \end{enumerate}
 Our goal is to construct a measure that satisfies as many conditions as possible.
 
 \subsubsection{Length of Intervals}
 
 The length of an interval I with end points $a\leq b$, $a,b \in R$, is defined as:
 $$l(I) = b-a$$
 For example, $l((0,1])=l([0,1])=1$ and $l((1,\infty))=\infty$.
 
 We immediately conclude that, if $I_1$ and $I_2$ are two intervals with $I_1 \subset I_2$, $l(I1) \leq l(I2)$.
 
 \subsubsection{Cover}
 
 A collection $\{G_{\alpha}\}$ of open sets covers a set A if $A \subset \bigcup G_{\alpha}$. And the collection $\{G_{\alpha}\}$ is called the cover.
 
 \subsubsection{Subcover}
 
 Let C be a cover of a topological space X. A subcover of C is a subset of C that still covers X.
 
 \subsubsection{Compact Set}
 
A set of real numbers is compact if every open cover of the set contains a finite subcover.

\subsubsection{Heine-Borel Theorem}
A set of real numbers is compact iff it is closed and bounded.

\subsubsection{Result}
If $I,I_1,I_2,\dots ,I_n$ are bounded open intervals with 

$$ I \subset \bigcup_{1}^{n}I_k ,\; then  \;l(I) \leq \sum l(I_k)$$

The length of an interval can not exceed the length of a $finite$ cover.

\subsubsection{Proposition}

If $I,I_1,I_2,\dots ,I_n$ are bounded open intervals with $ I \subset \bigcup I_k$, then $l(I) \leq \sum l(I_k)$. Also, $ l(I) \leq inf\{ \sum l(I_k) | I \subset \bigcup I_k, I_k \; bounded \; intervals \}$.

Proof: Assume $I =(a,b)$ and let $\epsilon > 0$. The intervals $(a-\epsilon,a+\epsilon),(b+\epsilon,b-\epsilon),I_1,\dots ,I_n$ form an open cover of the compact set $[a,b]$. And by Heine-Borel Theorem, a finite sub collection will cover [a,b] and thus (a,b).
Using 1.1.6:
$$  l(I) \leq 4\epsilon +  \sum l(I_k)$$

As this holds for any $\epsilon$, $l(I) \leq \sum l(I_k)$, the proof is complete.

\subsection{Lebesgue Outer Measure}

We have seen that every set of real numbers can be covered with a countable collection of open intervals.

\subsubsection{Definition}

A is any subset of R. Form the collection of all countable covers of A by open intervals. The Lebesgue outer measure of A, $m^*(A)$, is given by
$$m^*(A)= inf{\sum_{1}^{\infty}l(I_k)| A \subset \bigcup_{1}^{\infty} I_k \, , \; I_k \; open \; intervals}$$

\subsubsection{Results}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $m^*$ is a set function, whose domain is all subsets of R, and range is $[0,\infty]$, the non-negative extended real numbers. Note that the Lebesgue Outer Measure is defined for every subset of R.
    
    \item Outer Measure is monotonic, i.e. , if $A \subseteq B$, then $m^*(A) \leq m^*(B)$, any cover of B by open intervals is also a cover of A, and the latter infimum is taken over a larger collection than the former. 

    \item If $(I_k)$ is any countable cover of A by open intervals, since infimum is a lower bound,$$ 0 \leq m^*(A) \leq \sum l(I_k)$$
    


\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The outer measure of any interval is it's length.}

Proof:  
For a closed interval [a,b], let $\epsilon >0$. Then $(a-\epsilon,b+\epsilon)$ covers $[a,b]$ and length of this interval is $b-a+\epsilon$. Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary $m^*([a,b]) \leq b-a = l([a,b])$.

Next let ${I_n}$ be a covering of [a,b] by bounded open intervals. By the Heine-Borel Theorem, there exists a finite subset A of $I_n$'s covering [a,b]. So $a \in I_1$ for some $I_1 =(a_1,b_1) \in A$. Also, if $b_1 \leq b$, then $b_1 \in I_2 $ for some $I_2 =(a_2,b_2) \in A$. Similarly we can construct $I_1,I_2,\dots,I_k$. Then
$$ \sum l(I_n) \geq \sum_{i=1}^k l(I_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}(b_i - a_i)$$
$$=(b_k-a_k) +(b_{k-1} -a_{k-1})+ \dots + (b_1 - a_1) $$
$$ >b_k -a_1$$
Since $a_1<a$ and $b_k>b$, then $ \sum l(I_n) > b_k -a_1 $. So, $m^*([a,b]) = b-a = l([a,b])$.

If I is an unbounded interval, then given any natural number $n \in N$, there is a closed interval $J \subset I$ with $l(J)=n$. Hence $m^*(I) \geq m^*(J) = l(J)=n$. Since $m^*(I) \geq n \, and \, n \in N$ is arbitrary, then $m^*(I)=\infty=l(I)$. 

\subsubsection{Outer Measure is translation invariant}
$m^*(A)=m^*(A+y)$

Proof: Suppose $m^*(A) = M < \infty$. Then for all $\epsilon > 0 $ there exist ${I_n}$ bounded open intervals, such that they cover A. And from sec 1.1.7. $\sum l(I_n) < M+ \epsilon$, so if $y \in R$, then ${I_{n}+y}$ is a covering of A+y and so $m^{*}(A+y) \leq \sum l(I_n + y ) = \sum l(I_n) < M + \epsilon$ .Therefore $m^*(A+y) \leq M$.

Now, let ${J_n}$ be a collection of bounded open intervals such that $\cup J_n \supset A+y $.Assume that $\sum l(J_n)< M$. Then ${J_n-y}$ is a covering of A and $\sum l(J_n-y)=\sum l(J_n) < M$, a contradiction. So, $\sum l(J_n) \geq M$ and hence $m^*(A)\geq M$. So $m^*(A)=m^*(A+y)=M$

Suppose $m^*(A)= \infty$.Then for any$\{I_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} $ a set of bounded open intervals such that $A \subset \cup I_n$, we must
have$\sum l(I_n) =\infty$ .Consider A+y. For any $\{J_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} $ a set of bounded open intervals such that $A+y \subset \cup J_n$, the collection $\{J_n - y\}_{n=1}^{\infty} $ is a set of bounded open intervals such that $A+y \subset \cup J_n -y$. So $\sum l(J_n - y) =\infty$. But l($J_n$) =l($J_n - y$), so we must have $\sum l(J_n) =\infty$. Since $\{J_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} $ is an arbitrary collection of bounded open intervals covering A+y, we must have $m^*(A)=m^*(A+y)= \infty$. 

\subsubsection{Outer Measure is countably sub-additive}

That is, if $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty} $ is any countable collection of sets, then
$$ m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} m^{*}(E_k)$$

Proof: If one of the $E_k$'s has infinite outer measure, the inequality holds trivially. We therefore suppose each of the $E_k$'s has finite outer measure. Let $\epsilon > 0$. For each natural number k, there is a countable collection $\{ I_{k,i} \}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ of open bounded intervals for which
$$ E_k \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} \{ I_{k,i} \} \; and \; \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} l(I_{k,i}) < m^{*}(E_k) +\frac{\epsilon}{2^k}  $$

Now, $\{I_{k,i}\}_{1 \leq k , i \leq \infty}$ is a countable collection of open, bounded intervals that covers $\cup_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k$: the collection is countable since it is a countable collection of countable collections. Thus,

$$ m^{*}(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k) \leq \sum_{1\leq k,i<\infty } l(I_{k,i})= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}[\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} l(I_{k,i})]$$
$$\;\;\;<\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}[m^{*}(E_k) + \frac{\epsilon}{2^k}]$$
$$  m^{*}(\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k) \leq [\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}m^{*}(E_k)]+\epsilon$$

Since this holds for each $\epsilon>0$, it also holds for $\epsilon=0$. The proof is complete.

The finite sub-additivity property follows from countable sub-additivity by taking $E_k = \phi$ for $k>n$.

\subsubsection{$[0,1]$ is not countable}

As seen in Sec.1.2.3 $[0,1]$ has an outer measure of 1, whereas all countable sets have a measure 0, (refer to Royden and Fitzpatrick pg.31), therefore $[0,1]$ is not countable.


\subsection{$\sigma$-Algebra of Lebesgue Measurable sets}

Unfortunately the outer measure fails to be countably additive on all subsets of R, it is not even finitely additive. A famous example is the Vitali Set, found by Giuseppe Vitali in 1905. However, we can salvage matters by measuring a certain class of sets in $R$, henceforth called the measurable sets. Once we restrict ourselves to measurable sets, we recover all the properties again.

\subsubsection{Carathedory's Measurability Criteria}

E is any set of real numbers. If

$$m^*(X)= m^*(X \cap E) + m^*(x \cap E^c) $$
for every set X of real numbers, then the set E is said to be Lebesgue Measurable set of real numbers.

\subsubsection{Definition of $\sigma$-Algebra}
A $\sigma$-algebra (or $\sigma$-field) $\Sigma$ on a set $\Omega$ is a subset of $P(\Omega)$ (the power set of $\Omega$) such that it satisfies the following properties -


\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\Omega$ $\in$ $\Sigma$ \textit{(property 1)}
	\item If A is an element of $\Sigma$ then its complement also is an element of $\Sigma$ i.e A $\in$ $\Sigma$ $\Rightarrow$ A$^c$ $\in$ $\Sigma$ \textit{(\textit{property 2})}
	\item If $A_i \in \Sigma$, 
	$i\in \mathbb{N}$, then $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i \in \Sigma$\textit{(\textit{property 3})}
\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Consider $\Sigma$ $=$ \{$\phi$, $\Omega$\}. The given set is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ as it satisfies all the properties needed. Observe that $\phi$ is also included in $\Sigma$ by \textit{property 2}. \textit{Property 1} is also satisfied by the given $\sigma$-algebra. $\phi $ $\cup$ $\Omega$ = $\Omega$ $\in \Sigma$, so \textit{property 3} is also satisfied.
	\item Consider $\Sigma$ = $P(\Omega)$. Then, $\Sigma$ satisfies \textit{property 1} as $\Omega$ $\in$ $\Sigma$. Furthermore, $X^c$ = $\phi$ $\in$ $\Sigma$ and hence it satisfies \textit{property 2}. As $\Sigma$ contains all the subsets of $\Omega$, it is guaranteed that the union of any number of subsets of $\Omega$ exists in $\Sigma$, and hence satisfying \textit{property 3}. Hence $\Sigma$ = $P(\Omega)$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. 
	\item Consider $\Sigma$ = \{$\phi$, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}, $\Omega$\} and $\Omega$ = \{1, 2, 3\}. Here, $\Sigma$ is \textbf{not} a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ as \{1, 2\}$^c$ = \{3\} is not an element of $\Sigma$, and hence $\Sigma$ does not satisfy \textit{property 2}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Proposition 1}
If $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$, and A$_1$, A$_2$, A$_3$,....A$_n$ $\in$ $\Sigma$, then $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n$A$_i$ $\in$ $\Sigma$.

\textbf{Proof: }If A$_1$, A$_2$, A$_3$,....A$_n$ $\in$ $\Sigma$, then A$_1^c$, A$_2^c$, A$_3^c$,....A$_n^c$ $\in$ $\Sigma$ and $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n$A$_i^c$ $\in$ $\Sigma$. Then by \textit{property 2}, $(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n$A$_i^c)^c$ = $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n$A$_i$ $\in$ $\Sigma$.


\subsubsection{Proposition 2}
If $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ and A, B $\in$ $
Sigma$, then A$\setminus$B = A - B $\in$ $\Sigma$.

\textbf{Proof: }If B $\in$ $\Sigma$, then B$^c$ $\in$ $\Sigma$ by  \textit{property 2}. So, A $\cap$ B$^c$ = A$\setminus$B $\in$ $\Sigma$ (As seen in proposition 1).


\subsubsection{Proposition 3}
If $\Sigma_i$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$, i $\in \mathbb{N}$, then $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n$ $\Sigma_i$ is also a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$.

\textbf{Proof: }Consider the $\sigma$-algebras $\Sigma_1$, $\Sigma_2$, $\Sigma_3$,... $\Sigma_n$ defined on $\Omega$, then the smallest intersection of all such $\sigma$-algebras would be \{$\phi$, $\Omega$\}, which is a $\sigma$-algebra by definition. Also, if A is an element of the intersection, then A$^c$ would also be an element of the intersection, which satisfies \textit{property 2}. Also, A $\cup$ A$^c$ = $\Omega$ $\in$ $\Sigma$ which satisfies properties 1 and 3.



\subsubsection{Proposition 4}
For $Y$ $\subseteq$ P($\Omega$), there exists a smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains $Y$, called the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $Y$, given by the intersection of all such $\sigma$-algebras $\Sigma$ such that $\Sigma \supseteq Y$. That is, $\sigma$($Y$) = $\bigcap\limits_{\Sigma \supseteq Y}\Sigma$.

\textbf{Proof: }Consider $\sigma$-algebras $\Sigma_1$, $\Sigma_2$, $\Sigma_3$,....  $\Sigma_n$ $\supseteq $ $Y$ defined on $\Omega$. Then $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n \Sigma_i \supseteq Y$. As $Y \in$ $\Sigma_i$, $Y^c \in \Sigma_i$ for i = 1, 2, 3...n which satisfies \textit{property 2}. Furthermore, $\Omega$ $\in \Sigma_i$ which satisfies \textit{property 1}. $Y \cup Y^c$ = $\Omega$ which satisfies \textit{property 3}. Hence $\sigma(Y)$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.

For example, consider $\Omega$ = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} and $Y$ = \{\{1\}, \{2\}\}. Then the smallest $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ containing $Y$ is $\sigma(Y)$ = \{$\phi$, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}, \{3, 4\}, \{1, 3, 4\}, \{2, 3, 4\}, $\Omega$\}. Also note that if $Y$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, then $\sigma(Y)$ = $Y$.
